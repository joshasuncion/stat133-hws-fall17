Cooking Recipe: Filipino Lumpia
-------------------------------

![](http://barefeet.ogbeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lumpia1.jpg)

### Ingredients

-   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-   1 pound ground pork
-   2 cloves garlic, crushed
-   1/2 cup chopped onion
-   1/2 cup minced carrots
-   1/2 cup chopped green onions
-   1/2 cup thinly sliced green cabbage
-   1 teaspoon ground black pepper
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1 teaspoon soy sauce
-   30 lumpia wrappers
-   2 cups vegetable oil for frying

### Instructions

1.  Place a large skillet over high heat, and pour in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Cook pork, stirring frequently, until no pink is showing. Remove pork from pan and set aside. Drain grease from pan, leaving a thin coating. Cook garlic and onion in the same pan for 2 minutes. Stir in the cooked pork, carrots, green onions, and cabbage. Season with pepper, salt, garlic powder, and soy sauce. Remove from heat, and set aside until cool enough to handle.

2.  Place three heaping tablespoons of the filling diagonally near one corner of each wrapper, leaving a 1 and 1/2 inch space at both ends. Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both ends, and roll neatly. Keep the roll tight as you assemble. Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. Cover the rolls with plastic wrap to retain moisture.

3.  Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add oil to 1/2 inch depth, and heat for 5 minutes. Slide 3 or 4 lumpia into the oil. Fry the rolls for 1 to 2 minutes, until all sides are golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.

### Notes

As the *staple* Filipino food, lumpia can be served all year long. Lumpia is meant to be served as an appetizer, snack, or side dish, and it is best served with sweet and sour sauce or banana ketchup. Other variations of lumpia use different meat, such as ground beef, shrimp, and chicken.

Quadratic Equation
------------------

The [quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation) is a polynomial equation with the form *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0, where *a*, *b*, and *c* are nonzero coefficients and *x* is the unknown variable.

The roots of the quadratic equation, found by solving for *x*, can be obtained by factoring, completing the square, graphing, or by using the quadratic formula, which is given by
$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Comments and Reflections
------------------------

This was my first time using markdown. I found especially hard and time-consuming to correctly format the mathematical equations. I found that the latex syntax did not come naturally to me and I had trouble formatting the quadratic formula. Also, I found it somewhat tedious in trying to find out how to write certain math symbols, such as square roots, fractions, and plus minus signs.

However, I found the rest of the homework to be somewhat easy. I quickly picked up how to format *italics*, **bold text**, headings, links, images, lists, etc. It was also easy to create blockquotes

[CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/help/), [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Mathematical_expressions), and [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) were especially helpful in completing this assignment. In all, I spent around 1 and 1/2 hours learning markdown and latex and completing the homework.
