## Working on a HW assignment

- You should organize most HW assignments with the following file structure:

```
hw04/
  data/
  code/
  report/
  README.md
```

- Use the directory `data/` to put the data file(s)
- Use the directory `code/` to put all your `.R` files (e.g. scripts, functions, tests)
- Use the directory `report/` to put your `.Rmd` file (or slides)
- Make sure the `README.md` file contains:
	+ Title of the HW assignment
	+ Brief description
	+ Special instructions for any user (if necessary)
	+ Special instructions for graders (if necessary)
	+ Links to any resources that you used to complete the HW
	+ List of references that you used to complete the HW
- Some assignments may need more directories: e.g. `app/`, `images/`


As soon as you start working on a HW:

- Keep track of changes with Git
- Commit changes
- Push commits to your github repository
- Don't wait till the last day/hours/minutes to push to Github


## Submitting your work

You should submit the repository link of each HW to bCourses, providing the commit number that corresponds to the closest time-stamp before the due date.

You can keep working on a HW once its due date has passed. However, we won't grade anything after the due date. Why bother? Because it is good professional practice. And it will help you have a nice portfolio for the course that you could show to the rest of the world (don't underestimate this).
